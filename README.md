# asteroids-scriptable-objects
Futuregames Assignment

I implemented a tool that opens a window through which you can easily customize the game settings.
More specifically you can alter the ships throttle and rotational speed as well as its health.
You can also alter several properties of the asteroids that spawn.

You can access the tool through the "Tools" tab in the unity menu, the tool is called "Settings".
